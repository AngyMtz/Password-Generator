In this project I attempted to complete the acceptance criteria for this week's assignment PASSWORD GENERATOR

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

For this project I was able to complete the acceptance criteria.  And my password generator generates a password adhereing to the criteria specified by the user.  I was also implemented some error handling in my code to ensure that if the user inputs an invalid answer they will be prompted to try again and enter a valid one.
